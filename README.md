#### Setuo and run

## Getting Started
To open a Flutter project in Android Studio, you'll need to have Flutter and Dart plugins installed. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you open a Flutter project in Android Studio:

## Install Flutter and Dart SDKs:
Make sure you have Flutter and Dart SDKs installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

## Open Android Studio:
Launch Android Studio and make sure it's properly set up on your system.

## Install Flutter and Dart Plugins:
Navigate to the "Settings" or "Preferences" in Android Studio. Go to "Plugins" and search for "Flutter" and "Dart". Install these plugins if they are not already installed.

## Import the Flutter Project:
Once you have the Flutter and Dart plugins installed, you can import the Flutter project:

## Open Android Studio.
Select "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen or go to "File" > "Open..." and choose your Flutter project directory.
Select the android folder inside your Flutter project (where the android project resides) and click "OK" to open the project.
Wait for Gradle Build:
Android Studio will start the Gradle build process. It might take a few minutes, especially if it's the first time you're opening the project, as it will download necessary dependencies.

## Run Your Flutter Application:
After the project is successfully imported, you can run your Flutter application by opening a terminal inside Android Studio and running the following command

flutter run
